      </h3>


       <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ pound ground veal</li>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
        

       </ul>

       <h3>Directions</h3>

         <ol>
            <li> 
                <p><h4>Preparing the meat</h4></p>
                Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Mix in cheese, eggs, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper.
            </li>

            <li> 
                <p><h4>Making the meatballs</h4></p>
                Add bread crumbs and slowly mix in water, 1/2 cup at a time, until mixture is moist but still holds its shape (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water); shape into meatballs.
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <p><h4>Cooking the meat</h4></p>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet; add meatballs in batches and cook until browned on all sides, slightly crisp, and cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
            </li>

         </ol>
